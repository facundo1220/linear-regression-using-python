# linear-regression-using-python

This is a project created based on the one explained in https://towardsdatascience.com/coding-linear-regression-from-scratch-c42ec079902, in order to implement a step-by-step linear regression process with the objective of comparing its performance with that of specialized sklearn libraries for linear regression to verify the differences and implement new strategies for a better result with the use of optimizers.
